    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
<li> 1 recipe Yeasted Olive Oil Pastry </li>
<li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
<li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
<li>1 small cabbage, about 1 pound, cored and finely shredded</li>
<li>Salt to taste</li>
<li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill</li>
<li>2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped</li>
<li>Freshly ground pepper</li>
<li>½cup ricotta (optional)</li>
<li>1egg, beaten, for egg wash</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
<li> Mix up the pastry dough and while it is rising, make the filling.
    
    
  <li>  Heat butter over medium heat in a large, heavy skillet and add onion. Cook, stirring often, until tender, about 5 minutes. </li>
   <li> Add cabbage and salt to taste and cook, stirring often, until cabbage is tender but not browned, about 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> Stir in dill, chopped hard-boiled eggs, and pepper. Taste and adjust salt. </li>
     <li>Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly. If using ricotta you can either stir it into the cabbage or place a teaspoon on each round of dough before topping with the cabbage mixture.</li>
   <li> When the dough is ready, pinch off 24 equal pieces, approximately 20 grams each, and roll each one into a small ball by cupping your hand over it and gently rolling it against your work surface. </li>
    <li>Cover with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rest for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>

    <li>Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. One by one, roll each ball of dough to a thin round, about 3½ inches in diameter. If you are using ricotta and have not mixed it into the cabbage, place a teaspoon on each round and top with a tablespoon (heaped) of the cabbage. </li>
       <li> Otherwise just top each round with a heaped tablespoon of the cabbage mixture.</li> 
        <li>Fold over the round and pinch the edges of the dough together, then tuck in the ends and gently shape each pirozhok into an oval (rather than a half-moon). </li>
        <li>Place on the parchment-covered baking sheet, seam side down. You should get 12 on each sheet.</li>

         <li>After you have finished shaping the first 12, cover lightly with plastic and place in a warm place to rise for 40 to 45 minutes. </li>
         <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees and continue shaping the pirozhki. Cover the second batch with plastic and let rise for 40 to 45 minutes.</li>
    
        
       <li>Brush pirozhki with egg wash. Bake 1 tray at a time in the middle of the oven for 25 minutes, until light brown and shiny. </li>
       <li> Remove from heat and allow to cool for at least 10 minutes before eating.</li>
